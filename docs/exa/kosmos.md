### `referring_expression_comprehension(self, phrase, image_url)`

This method performs referring expression comprehension with a given phrase and image URL.

#### Parameters

-   `phrase` (str): The phrase to use for referring expression comprehension.
-   `image_url` (str): The URL of the image to use for referring expression comprehension.

### `referring_expression_generation(self, phrase, image_url)`

This method generates referring expressions with a given phrase and image URL.

#### Parameters

-   `image_url` (str): The URL of the image to use for referring expression generation.

### `grounded_vqa(self, question, image_url)`

This method performs grounded visual question answering with a given question and image URL.

#### Parameters

-   `question` (str): The question to use for grounded visual question answering.
-   `image_url` (str): The URL of the image to use for grounded visual question answering.

### `grounded_image_captioning(self, image_url)`

This method generates a grounded image caption for a given image URL.

#### Parameters

-   `image_url` (str): The URL of the image to caption.

### `grounded_image_captioning_detailed(self, image_url)`

This method generates a detailed grounded image caption for a given image URL.

#### Parameters

-   `image_url` (str): The URL of the image to caption.

### `draw_entity_boxes_on_image(image, entities, show=False, save_path=None)`

This method draws bounding boxes around entities in an image.

#### Parameters

-   `image` (Image or str or torch.Tensor): The image or image path or image tensor on which to draw bounding boxes.
-   `entities` (list): A list of entities to draw bounding boxes around.
-   `show` (bool): Whether to display the image. Default is `False`.
-   `save_path` (str): The path to save the image. If `None`, the image

#### Returns

-   `new_image` (numpy.ndarray): The image with bounding boxes drawn around entities.

### `generate_boxees(self, prompt, image_url)`

This method generates bounding boxes for entities in an image based on a given prompt.

#### Parameters

-   `prompt` (str): The prompt to use for generating bounding boxes.
-   `image_url` (str): The URL of the image to use for generating bounding boxes.


## Usage Examples
--------------

### Example 1: Multimodal Grounding

```
from Kosmos import Kosmos

kosmos = Kosmos()
kosmos.multimodal_grounding("Find the red apple in the image.", "https://example.com/apple.jpg")
```


### Example 2: Referring Expression Comprehension

```
from Kosmos import Kosmos

kosmos = Kosmos()
kosmos.referring_expression_comprehension("Show me the green bottle.", "https://example.com/bottle.jpg")
```

## Additional Information
----------------------

The `Kosmos` class uses the `transformers` library to load a pretrained model and processor. The model is used to generate responses based on the given prompts and images, and the processor is used to process the inputs and outputs of the model.

The `Kosmos` class provides a set of methods for performing various tasks related to multimodal grounding, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation, grounded visual question answering, and grounded image captioning. These tasks involve generating responses based on the given prompts and images, and drawing bounding boxes around entities in the images.

The `Kosmos` class also provides a method for retrieving an image from a given URL, and a method for running the model with a given prompt and image. These methods are used internally by the other methods of the class.

The `Kosmos` class can be used in a variety of applications, such as image captioning, visual question answering, and object detection. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for performing these tasks, making it easy to use for both beginners and experienced developers.
